## 6.10 Exercises on TCP timers and retransmission

For this experiment, we will reuse the same network as in the [previous experiment](el5373-lab6-67.md).

### Exercise 5

On "romeo", execute

```
sudo sysctl -A | grep keepalive
```

to display the default values of the TCP kernel parameters that are related to the TCP keepalive timer.

**Lab report**: What is the default value of the TCP keepalive timer? What is the maximum number of TCP keepalive probes a host can send?

To observe TCP keepalive packets, we will reduce the time before TCP begins sending keepalive packets. On "romeo", run

```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time=60
```

Then, while `tcpdump` is capturing the traffic between "romeo" and "juliet", on "romeo", run

```
telnet 10.10.2.100
```

and enter the username and password when prompted. Don't type anything in the `telnet` session, and wait for the keepalive timer to elapse.


**Lab report**: Explain how TCP keepalive works, using your `tcpdump` output.
