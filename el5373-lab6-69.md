## 6.9 Exercise on TCP bulk data flow

For this experiment, we will reuse the same network as in the [previous experiment](el5373-lab6-67.md).

### Exercise 4

On "juliet", download a small file (e.g. an image file) from the Internet to your home directory. Rename it to `out.file`.

While `tcpdump` is running and capturing the packets between "romeo" and "juliet", on "romeo" run

```
nc -l -p 1234 > out.file
```

Then, on "juliet", run

```
nc -w 3 10.10.1.100 1234 < out.file
```

to transfer the file from "juliet" to "romeo".

Do the same experiment three times. Save the `tcpdump` outputs for your lab report.

**Lab report**: Using one of the three `tcpdump` outputs, explain the operation of TCP in terms of data segments and their acknowledgements. Does the number of data segments different from that of their acknowledgements?

Compare all the `tcpdump` outputs you saved. Discuss any differences among them, in terms of data segments and their acknowledgements.

**Lab report**: From the `tcpdump` output, how many different TCP flags can you see? Enumerate the flags and explain their meanings.

How many different TCP options can you see? Explain their meanings.
