## 9.10 Exercises on secure applications


For this experiment, we will reuse the same network as in the [previous experiment](el7353-lab9-909.md), with two hosts connected by a router.

However, we will need to make some changes to the end host configuration and install some software.

On "romeo", create a new user account with the username "shakespeare":

```
sudo useradd -m shakespeare -s /bin/sh  
sudo passwd shakespeare
```

and enter a password for "shakespeare" when prompted. (No characters will appear as you type.)


Install `telnet` with

```
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get -y install xinetd telnetd  
```

Then create the telnet configuration file with

```
sudo nano /etc/xinetd.d/telnet  
```

Paste the following into the file:

```
# default: on
# description: telnet server
service telnet  
{
disable = no  
flags = REUSE  
socket_type = stream  
wait = no  
user = root  
server = /usr/sbin/in.telnetd  
log_on_failure += USERID  
}
```

Hit Ctrl+O and Enter to save the file, and Ctrl+X to exit nano. Finally, restart the service on "romeo" with

```
sudo service xinetd restart  
```

Next, we will start an SSH server process on the "romeo" host. Hosts on GENI already have SSH servers on them, but these are configured to allow remote access to GENI users and administrators. We will start a second, parallel SSH server process on "romeo", that will run on port 1000 on the experiment interface. ("Our" SSH server runs on a non-default port because the default port, 22, is already in use by the existing SSH server):

```
sudo /usr/sbin/sshd -o ListenAddress=10.10.1.100 -f /usr/share/doc/openssh-client/examples/sshd_config -p 1000
```

Finally, install the SFTP server:

```
sudo apt-get -y install vsftpd
```

### Exercise 4

In this exercise, we will compare `telnet` and `SSH`, two applications used for remote access to a host. 

On the "router" host, run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w security-telnet-$(hostname -s).pcap
```

to capture traffic between "romeo" and "juliet". While this is running, initiate a `telnet` connection from "juliet" to "romeo" - on "juliet", run

```
telnet romeo
```

When prompted for a "login", enter

```
shakespeare
```

and hit "Enter". Then, when prompted for a password, enter the password you set previously for the "shakespeare" user on "romeo".

After you have successfully logged in using `telnet`, type 

```
exit
```

in the `telnet` session and hit "Enter" to end it. Stop the `tcpdump` running on the router with Ctrl+C.


Next, on the "router" host, run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w security-ssh-$(hostname -s).pcap
```

to capture traffic between "romeo" and "juliet". While this is running, initiate an SSH connection from "juliet" to "romeo" on port 1000 - on "juliet", run

```
ssh shakespeare@romeo -p 1000
```

Type `yes` when prompted to confirm the connection. Then, when prompted for a password, enter the password you set previously for the "shakespeare" user on "romeo".

After you have successfully logged in using SSH, type 

```
exit
```

in the SSH session and hit "Enter" to end it. Stop the `tcpdump` running on the router with Ctrl+C.

Transfer both packet captures to your laptop with `scp`, and analyze with Wireshark. Examine the individual packet payloads, and also use the Analyze > Follow > TCP Stream tool (while one of the packets in the TCP stream is selected).

**Lab report**: In the packet capture of the `telnet` experiment, can you read: the username and password? IP/TCP/Telnet headers? TCP data? Show evidence. 

**Lab report**: In the packet capture of the SSH experiment, can you read: the username and password? IP/TCP/SSH headers? TCP data? Show evidence. 

**Lab report**: What is the difference between SSH and `telnet` in their transmission of user IDs, passwords, and other data? Is one more secure than the other and why? 

### Exercise 5

In this exercise, we will compare FTP and SFTP, two applications used for file transfer to and from a remote host. SFTP tunnels FTP traffic over an SSH session.

On the "router" host, run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w security-ftp-$(hostname -s).pcap
```

to capture traffic between "romeo" and "juliet". While this is running, initiate an FTP session from "juliet" to "romeo" - on "juliet", run

```
ftp romeo
```

When prompted for a "Name", enter

```
shakespeare
```

and hit "Enter". Then, when prompted for a password, enter the password you set previously for the "shakespeare" user on "romeo".

After you have successfully authenticated your FTP session (you will see the message "230 Login successful"), type 

```
exit
```

in the FTP session and hit "Enter" to end it. Stop the `tcpdump` running on the router with Ctrl+C.


Next, on the "router" host, run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w security-sftp-$(hostname -s).pcap
```

to capture traffic between "romeo" and "juliet". While this is running, initiate an SFTP connection from "juliet" to "romeo" on port 1000 - on "juliet", run

```
sftp -P 1000 shakespeare@romeo
```

When prompted for a password, enter the password you set previously for the "shakespeare" user on "romeo".

After you have successfully authenticated your SFTP session, type 

```
exit
```

in the SFTP session and hit "Enter" to end it. Stop the `tcpdump` running on the router with Ctrl+C.


Transfer both packet captures to your laptop with `scp`, and analyze with Wireshark. Examine the individual packet payloads, and also use the Analyze > Follow > TCP Stream tool (while one of the packets in the TCP stream is selected).


**Lab report**: In the packet capture of the FTP experiment, can you read: the username and password? IP/TCP/FTP headers? TCP data? Show evidence. 

**Lab report**: In the packet capture of the SFTP experiment, can you read: the username and password? IP/TCP/SFTP headers? TCP data? Show evidence. 

**Lab report**: What is the difference between FTP and SFTP in their transmission of user IDs, passwords, and other data? Is one more secure than the other and why?
