# TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach

This repository includes the exercises in the textbook [TCP/IP Essentials: A Lab-Based Approach](https://www.amazon.com/TCP-IP-Essentials-Lab-Based-Approach/dp/052160124X), adapted to use the GENI testbed rather than an in-house lab.

### Bridges and LANs

* [Operation of a basic Ethernet switch or bridge](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/) (You will run this experiment and submit answers to the questions in the [Exercise](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/basic-ethernet-switch-operation/#exercise) section)
* [Additional questions on bridge operation](3-5-simple-bridge.md) (This uses the same topology as "Operation of a basic Ethernet switch or bridge", so don't delete your resources until you finish this section.)
* [Spanning tree protocol](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/) (You will run this experiment and submit answers to the questions in the [Exercise](https://witestlab.poly.edu/blog/the-spanning-tree-protocol/#exercise) section)
