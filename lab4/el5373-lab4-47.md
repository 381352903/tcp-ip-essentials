## 4.7 Routing experiments with ICMP

For this experiment, we will reuse the same network as in the previous experiment. 

While the routers can learn new routes using RIP, the workstations will not. You will have to add a route on each workstation so that it can reach other workstations outside its own subnet, by going through a local router.

On romeo, set up router 1 as the gateway for the entire 10.10.0.0/16 subnet:

```
sudo route add -net 10.10.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.10.61.1
```

On hamlet, set up router 2 as the gateway for the entire 10.10.0.0/16 subnet:

```
sudo route add -net 10.10.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.10.62.2
```

On othello, set up router 3 as the gateway for the entire 10.10.0.0/16 subnet:

```
sudo route add -net 10.10.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.10.63.3
```

On petruchio, set up router 4 as the gateway for the entire 10.10.0.0/16 subnet:

```
sudo route add -net 10.10.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw 10.10.64.4
```

With this configuration, every host should be able to reach every other host. However, it will not necessarily use the shortest path. For example, the shortest path from romeo to petruchio would be romeo ðŸ¡’ router 4 ðŸ¡’ petruchio. But, because romeo uses router 1 as its gateway to the other subnets, it will send traffic to petruchio using a longer path: romeo ðŸ¡’ router 1 ðŸ¡’ router 4 ðŸ¡’ petruchio.


In this section, we will see how routers can use an ICMP redirect message to inform hosts of a better route, in the scenario described above.

First, on romeo, run

```
ip route get 10.10.64.100
```

and save the output.


On each workstation (romeo, hamlet, othello, petruchio), run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-redirect-1.pcap
```

Then, `ping` from "romeo" to "petruchio". On "romeo", run

```
ping 10.10.64.100
```

After capturing an ICMP redirect message, save the `ping` output and stop the ping.

On "romeo", run

```
traceroute -n 10.10.64.100
```

and save the output. Also, stop the `tcpdump` processes with Ctrl+C.

By default, our workstations will not apply the routes suggested by the ICMP redirect message. To enable that feature, run

```
sudo sysctl -w net.ipv4.conf.all.accept_redirects=1
```

on "romeo". Restart the `tcpdump` processes on each segment, but write to a new file, with

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-redirect-2.pcap
```

Then, run 

```
ping 10.10.64.100
```

again on romeo until you see an ICMP redirect. Stop the ping and run

```
traceroute -n 10.10.64.100
```

and save the output. Then, stop the `tcpdump` processes.

Run 

```
ip route get 10.10.64.100
```

again on romeo, and save the output.

Stop the `tcpdump` processes, and play back the ICMP messages on romeo with

```
sudo tcpdump -r romeo-redirect-2.pcap -env icmp
```



**Lab report**: Show the `traceroute` output and the output of `ip route get 10.10.64.100` before and after the ICMP redirect instruction was applied, and explain the change. Also show the ICMP redirect message. Who sent this message?

**Lab report**: From the tcpdump output, explain how the multi-hop route was found using `traceroute`. Explain the sequence of messages used. What header field does romeo set in order to trigger the desired response?


### Exercise: Network Unreachable

In a [previous exercise](https://github.com/ffund/tcp-ip-essentials/blob/master/lab2/2-9-ip-subnet.md#exercise-10---network-unreachable), we observed what happens when a host tries to send a message to an address for which it has no relevant routing rule. Now, we'll see what happens when a host tries to send a message to an address for which *the router* has no relevant routing rule. Under those circumstances, the router may send an ICMP Destination Unreachable message to let the host know that it has no route for this destination.

Open a new SSH session to router 1, and follow the steps described in [Section 2.9](https://github.com/ffund/tcp-ip-essentials/blob/master/lab2/2-9-ip-subnet.md) to replace the default route on the control interface with one that is specific to the network that you are connecting from.

Then, open two terminals on romeo. 

In one terminal on romeo, run

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-icmp-dest-net-unreachable.pcap
```

In the second terminal on romeo, run

```
ping -c 3 10.10.66.1
```

to send a message to a network for which the gateway does not have a route. Note the response. 

Stop the `tcpdump` with Ctrl+C, and play back the captured packets with


```
tcpdump -r $(hostname -s)-icmp-dest-net-unreachable.pcap -envx
```

You can also transfer the file capture to your laptop with `scp`, so that you can open it in Wireshark.

Note the contents of the ICMP destination unreachable message that you captured. Check the source IP address - who sent this message?
