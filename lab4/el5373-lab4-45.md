## 4.5 A simple router experiment

For this experiment, we will use a topology with two workstations (named "romeo" and "juliet"), and a router in between them, with IP addresses configured as follows:

* romeo: 10.10.1.100
* router, interface connected to romeo: 10.10.1.1
* router, interface connected to juliet: 10.10.2.1
* juliet: 10.10.2.100

each with a netmask of 255.255.255.0. 

To set up this topology in the GENI Portal, create a slice, click on "Add Resources", and load the RSpec from the following URL: https://git.io/vFUGj

Then bind to an InstaGENI site and reserve your resources. Wait for them to become available for login ("turn green" on your canvas) and then SSH into each, using the details given in the GENI Portal.

Before you start, use `ifconfig -a` to capture the network interface configuration of each host in this topology. Draw a diagram of the topology, and label each network interface with its name, IP address, and MAC address. Include this diagram as an appendix to your lab report.

### Exercise 1

Initially, each host's routing table has no entry for the subnet on the other side of the router. Use

```
route -n
```

to inspect the routing table on each workstation and on the router.

In order to be connected, you need to add a routing entry for the other subnet in the routing table of each workstation. Use the `route` commands described earlier in this chapter, and add an appropriate route on each workstation.

Run 

```
sudo tcpdump -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-static.pcap
```

on both workstations. Then, from the "romeo" workstation, send "ping" messages continuously to the "juliet" workstation:

```
ping 10.10.2.100
```

After receiving the tenth reply, quit `ping` and save the `tcpdump` outputs from both machines. Also, copy the `ping` output.

**Lab report**: Show the routing table on each workstation and on the router before and after you added routes to establish connectivity between "romeo" and "juliet". (Only show the entries that are relevant to the "experiment" interfaces, not the entries for the control interfaces). 

**Lab report**: When a packet was sent to a workstation in the other subnet, explain how the source and destination Ethernet addresses were changed. 

* What are the source and destination addresses in the IP and Ethernet headers of a packet that went from the "romeo" machine to the router? 
* What are the source and destination addresses in the IP and Ethernet headers of a packet that went from the router to the "juliet" machine?

Answer the above two questions, but now for the echo _reply_ that was returned from the remote host.

Last week, you answered a similar question for traffic traversing a bridge. Compare the behavior of the bridge in last week's experiment (with respect to the packet headers) to the behavior of the router in this week's experiment.

Once you are done with this part of the lab , proceed to the [next part](el5373-lab4-46.md)
