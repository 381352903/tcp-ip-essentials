## 4.6 RIP exercises

In this section, we will examine the operation of RIP.

For this experiment, we will use a topology similar to Figure 4.11, "Network configuration of the RIP experiment" in the textbook, but with 10.10 as the first two octets of each IP address.

To set up this topology in the GENI Portal, create a slice, click on "Add Resources", and load the RSpec from the following URL: https://git.io/vFU62

Then bind to an InstaGENI site and reserve your resources. Wait for them to become available for login ("turn green" on your canvas), and wait a few more minutes beyond that for the configuration script to finish running. Then SSH into each, using the details given in the GENI Portal.

Before you start, use `ifconfig -a` to capture the network interface configuration of each host in this topology. Draw a diagram of the topology, and label each network interface with its name, IP address, and MAC address. Include this diagram as an appendix to your lab report.

On boot, each workstation will only have routing rules for its own subnet (and the control interface). It will not have routing rules for other subnets in the experiment topology. Confirm this with

```
route -n
```

### Exercise 2

The virtual routers in our experiment are running `quagga`, a software router that includes a shell interface similar to the Cisco IOS interface. Open the shell interface on each router with:

```
export VTYSH_PAGER=more
sudo vtysh
```

In the `quagga` shell, run

```
show ip route
```

to see what routes are currently configured on each router. Save this output.

Using this shell interface, we can configure the routers to use the RIP protocol.

First, enter Global Configuration mode in each router:


```
configure terminal
```

The prompt should change (to include a `(config)` at the end), indicating that you are now in configuration mode.

Then, type

```
router rip
```

to enable RIP. Finally, you need to associate one or more networks to the RIP routing process. Run

```
network 10.10.0.0/16
```

so that all addresses from 10.10.0.0-10.10.255.255 will be enabled for RIP. (Note: this syntax is slightly different in `quagga` then in Cisco IOS.) Then run `exit` twice, until you are back in the regular `quagga` shell (not in config mode).

RIPv2 multicasts its routing table every 30 seconds to the multicast IP address 224.0.0.9. On one workstation in each network segment, run

```
sudo tcpdump -en -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-rip.pcap
```

for about a minute or two, to capture these messages.

Also, run

```
show ip route
```

in the `quagga` shell on each router, to see the new routes, and save the output. (You can also see RIP-specific information with `show ip rip`.)

While the routers can learn new routes using RIP, the workstations will not. You will have to add a route on each workstation so that it can reach other workstations outside its own subnet, with:

```
sudo route add -net 10.10.0.0 netmask 255.255.0.0 gw ROUTER-IP
```

where for `ROUTER-IP`, you substitute the IP address of a router that is on the same LAN as this workstation. 


Now, use `ping` to verify that each workstation can reach every other workstation.

**Lab report**: Explain why you can only get two different RIP messages in your subnet. Was a RIP packet forwarded by the routers? Why?

**Lab report**: Draw the format of one of the saved RIP response packets from your, including the IP and UDP headers and the RIP message (see Figs 0.13, 0.14, and 4.4). Identify each field, and express their values in decimal format. For each of the other seven unique RIP response packets collected, explain the contents of the RIP messages only, excluding IP and UDP headers.

**Lab report**: Draw the distance tables and the routing tables in the routers based on Fig. 4.11, assuming that number of hops is used as the metric. Verify the routing tables using the RIP messages you captured.

### Exercise 3

In this exercise, we will examine how RIP reponds to link failures. Set up "romeo" to use Router 1 (10.10.61.1) as its gateway for the 10.10.0.0/16 network, and set up "hamlet" to use Router 2 (10.10.62.2) as its gateway for the 10.10.0.0/16 network. (If you've already configured them like this, you don't have to make any changes.)

On each of the routers, in the `quagga` shell, run

```
show ip rip
```

to see the current RIP database. Save the output.

Send `ping` messages continuously between "romeo" and "hamlet". Also, start `tcpdump` on "romeo" and "hamlet" (and save your packet capture to a file). Let these two programs run during this exercise.

Then, on Router 1, use the `quagga` shell to bring down the interface that connects Router 1 to the network segment that Router 2 is on (the interface that has the address 10.10.62.1). Run

```
configure terminal
interface eth1
shutdown
```

(or substitute for `eth1` the correct interface name). Then run `exit` twice to return to the regular `quagga` shell.


Observe the `ping` and `tcpdump` windows. When the `ping` connection is re-established, get the routing tables on all four routers again with 

```
show ip rip
```

and save the output. Then, in the `quagga` shell on Router 1, run

```
configure terminal
interface eth1
no shutdown
```

(or substitute for `eth1` the correct interface name) to bring back up the disabled interface. Also, run `exit` twice until you return to the regular `quagga` shell.

**Lab report**: Show the RIP tables you captured at each stage of this exercise. Explain how the routing tables changed when the most direct path between Router 1 and Router 2 was disabled.

**Lab report**: Use the `tcpdump` output to see how long it takes for RIP to alter the routing table after the topology of the network changes. Explain why it takes this time for RIP to react to the route change. Refer to Section 4.2.4 for RIP operation and default timer values.
