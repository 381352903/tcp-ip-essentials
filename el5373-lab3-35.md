## 4.5 A simple bridge experiment

For this experiment, we will use a topology with two workstations (named "romeo" and "juliet"), and a transparent bridge in between them, with IP addresses configured as follows:

* romeo: 10.10.1.1
* bridge, interface connected to romeo: 10.10.1.11
* bridge, interface connected to juliet: 10.10.1.12
* juliet: 10.10.1.2

each with a netmask of 255.255.255.0. 

To set up this topology in the GENI Portal, create a slice, click on "Add Resources", and load the RSpec from the following URL: 

Then bind to an InstaGENI site and reserve your resources. Wait for them to become available for login ("turn green" on your canvas) and then SSH into each, using the details given in the GENI Portal.

Before you start, use `ifconfig -a` to capture the network interface configuration of each host in this topology. Draw a diagram of the topology, and label each network interface with its name, IP address, and MAC address.

### Exercise 3

Configure transparent bridging on the bridge node.

First, flush the IP address from each bridge interface:

```
sudo ip addr flush dev eth1  
sudo ip addr flush dev eth2  
```


Next, run

```
sudo apt-get update  
sudo apt-get -y install bridge-utils  
```

to install the bridge utilities.

Then, create a new bridge interface named br0 with the command

```
sudo brctl addbr br0  
```

and add the two experiment interfaces to the bridge:

```
sudo brctl addif br0 eth1  
sudo brctl addif br0 eth2  
```

Run

```
sudo brctl stp br0 on  
```

to enable on the spanning tree algorithm on your bridge.

Then, bring the bridge interface up:

```
sudo ifconfig br0 up  
```

At this point, you should be able to list the bridge ports with

```
brctl show br0  
```

The output should look something like this:

```
bridge name    bridge id       STP enabled interfaces  
br0        8000.02b0102cb433   yes      eth1  
                                       eth2
```

Now that we have configured the bridge, we are ready for a simple bridge experiment. Run

```
sudo tcpdump -en -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-bridge.pcap
```

on both "romeo" and "juliet". Then, from the "romeo" workstation, send "ping" messages continuously to the "juliet" workstation:

```
ping 10.10.1.2

```

After receiving the tenth reply, quit `ping` and save the `tcpdump` outputs from both machines. Also, copy the `ping` output.


**Lab report**: What are the IP and MAC addresses of a packet that went from "romeo" to the bridge? What are the IP and MAC addresses of a packet that went from the bridge to "juliet"?

Answer the same questions, but for the echo _reply_ that was returned from "juliet" to "romeo".

**Lab report**: Using the `tcpdump` outputs from both machines, calculate the average delay that a packet experienced in the bridge. Note that the system times of the two machines might be different. Show all the steps and submit the `tcpdump` outputs with your report.

### Exercise 4

Run 

```
sudo tcpdump -en -i eth1 -w $(hostname -s)-bpdu.pcap
```

on both the "romeo" and "juliet" hosts to capture messages generated by the bridge. Save the BPDUs for the lab report.

**Lab report** How frequently (in seconds) does a bridge sends its BPDUs?

**Lab report** Submit the BPDU that you captured. Identify the values of root ID, root path cost, bridge ID, and port ID for the BPDU.
